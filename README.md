# this project is used by education institutions such as Universities,highschools and aslo other private companies who train interns
to monitor and manage interns'data during their industrial attachement period interns can record their journey,and they supervisors can grade them according to their activities
and finaly interns can report their work through the system
while they are on their internships my case study was University of tourism and business studies (utb) in Rwanda
